  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p1>
    I was born on March 29th, 2005 at a hospital in Kobe. My mother is from Japan and my father is from Canada. I have gone to the same international school my whole life, allowing me to speak both English and Japanese fluently. My main hobby is playing video games, and some of my favorite video games include Counter Strike for multiplayer and Red Dead Redemption 2 for single player. I also like listening to music a lot, and my favorite artist at the moment is a Japanese singer called Basi. My favorite school subject is history as I find it the most interesting, however I decided not to pursue a college degree relating to the subject as I knew that doing to a STEM major will grant me a better job in the future. I have also played many sports in my life, my two most played being tennis and soccer. Although I was never good at them, I enjoyed playing them a lot. Finally, as my future goal, I would like to become an engineer working in a company that uses both English and Japanese.
